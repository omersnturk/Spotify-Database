Born in 1987 in Izmir, Bonomo moved to Istanbul and continues to work in this city, which is one of his biggest inspirations.

      "about": "It's hard to place Duman under a single genre, as various influences can be heard throughout their albums -- but a grunge feel combined with Turkish folk themes and an overall Arabic vocal style could somewhat provide an initial clue. The hardcore fan base of Duman may be populated mostly by teenagers around the age of 18, but the band is actually a massive influence in the modern Turkish rock scene. Although they may not be the first to cover Arabic styles or folk songs, they were definitely the first to make such musical approaches huge in 21st century Turkey. Duman are comprised of three permanent members: Kaan Tangoze (vocals/guitars), Ari Borakas (bass), and Batuhan Mutlugil (guitars). The first roots of the band may be found in Mad Madam, which was a cover band with a set list full of songs from Seattle groups. Kaan Tangoze and Ari Borakas were together in Mad Madam until Tangoze flew to Seattle to earn a graduate degree. Upon returning to Turkey with a handful of songs molded in the spirit of the Seattle scene, Tangoze formed Duman with Ari Barakos from his former group and Batuhan Mutlugil from another local cover band. After first deciding to work with session drummers, drummer Alen Konakoglu took on this responsibility and the group released Eski Köprünün Altinda in 1999.",

      "artist_name": "Antonio Vivaldi",
      "about": "The creator of hundreds of spirited, extroverted instrumental works, Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi is widely recognized as the master of the Baroque instrumental concerto, which he perfected and popularized more than any of his contemporaries. Vivaldi's kinetic rhythms, fluid melodies, bright instrumental effects, and extensions of instrumental technique make his some of the most enjoyable of Baroque music. He was highly influential among his contemporaries and successors: even as esteemed a figure as Johann Sebastian Bach adapted some of Vivaldi's music. Vivaldi's variable textures and dramatic effects initiated the shift toward what became the Classical style; a deeper understanding of his music begins with the realization that, compared with Bach and even Handel, he was Baroque music's arch progressive. Though not as familiar as his concerti, Vivaldi's stage and choral music is still of value; his sometimes bouncy, sometimes lyrical Gloria in D major (1708) has remained a perennial favorite. His operas were widely performed in his own time.",
